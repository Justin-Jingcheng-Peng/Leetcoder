# Leetcoder

Feb. 18 update: There is still a bug in the input of the number. All other functions work well

Intro:
The objective of this project is to help programmers leetcode more efficiently. As we know, timing is important in leetcode practice. We have to make sure that we can solve problems in a limited time. However, many programmers forget about this. Thus, I came up with the idea of tracking the time that the programmer takes to solve the problems.

Architecture:
This project emphasized back-end development so the front-end was implemented without any frameworks. Using HTML, CSS, JS. The web server was constructed with NodeJS and ExpressJS. The database was MongoDB.

More future plans:
There is great potential for the future development of this project. First of all, the frontend could be increased significantly with React.JS, which is what I am learning right now. Also, more complicated functionality could be added by implementing some algorithms. For example, I might add sorting algorithms to sort all the tasks created by the client and do some simple data analysis at the backend.
